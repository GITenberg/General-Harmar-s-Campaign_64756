<p>General Josiah Harmar&rsquo;s ill-fated campaign in 1790
was the first of three historic expeditions against the Indians
in the Old Northwest. The defeat of General Arthur St. Clair
followed in 1791, and the victory of General Anthony Wayne
in 1794.</p>
<p>The first article in this pamphlet identifies the exact
sites of the Indian villages around the three rivers. The
destruction of these villages was one of the objectives of
Harmar&rsquo;s campaign. The journal of one of Harmar&rsquo;s soldiers
and admirers provides a firsthand account of this
expedition and is printed as the second article. The third
article is a speech delivered by James McGrew at a meeting
of the Maumee Valley Monumental and Historical Association
on August 15, 1888.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">INDIAN VILLAGES NEAR FORT WAYNE</span></h2>
<p>On October 15, 1790, Colonel Hardin and a detachment
of six hundred of General Harmar&rsquo;s men reached the Indian
towns at the forks of the Maumee River. The destruction
of these towns was the object of General Harmar&rsquo;s expedition.
When Colonel Hardin&rsquo;s command arrived at the towns,
they found them abandoned by the Indians. The principal
one, called Omee Town, had been burned. On the seventeenth,
General Harmar and the remainder of the army
joined Colonel Hardin.</p>
<p>Most readers know that there were a number of Indian
villages at and near the junction of the St. Mary&rsquo;s and St.
Joseph rivers, but few persons know the exact location of
these towns. To add to the general information which we
have heretofore given on Fort Wayne&rsquo;s early history, we
present the testimony of a writer who wrote a supplement
to the official account sent to the War Department. That
writer included some details which could not go into the official
report. The supplement was written in 1791 and was
published in the PHILADELPHIA DAILY GENERAL ADVERTIZER
of that year; hence, it may be considered accurate.
It was read in 1840 by the late John W. Vancleve of Dayton,
Ohio, who knew much of the report to be true. With reference
to the towns at the forks of the Maumee, we quote as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were at that time seven towns on the three
rivers in the vicinity of the confluence of the St. Joseph and
St. Mary&rsquo;s rivers. The principal Miami village was called
Omee Town, and among its inhabitants were a considerable
number of French traders. Omee Town stood upon the east
bank of the St. Joseph, or north side of the Maumee, directly
opposite the mouth of the St. Mary&rsquo;s; it had been
burned before Colonel Hardin&rsquo;s arrival. Another Miami
village of thirty houses stood on the bank opposite Omee
Town. The Delawares had three villages. Two were on the
St. Mary&rsquo;s about three miles from its mouth, with forty-five
houses in all; the other village was on the east bank of
the St. Joseph two or three miles from its mouth, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
thirty-six houses. The Shawnee had two villages about three
miles down the Maumee. Chillicothe was on the north bank
with fifty-eight houses, and the other village of sixteen
houses was on the opposite side of the river. The army
burned all the houses in the different villages and destroyed
about twenty thousand bushels of corn which had been hidden
by the Indians. Considerable property belonging to the
French traders was also destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above quotation contains the best information that
we have found concerning the Indian towns at this place. It
locates the exact sites of the Miami towns. The large village
was built on the bottom land at the junction of the Maumee
and St. Joseph rivers, and the smaller one was on the
tract afterward called the Wells Pre-emption between Spy
Run and the St. Joseph River. It also ascertains that Chillicothe
was a Shawnee town three miles down the Maumee
River. The spot is identified on which General Harmar
dated his orders on October 20, 1790, before starting his
return march to Fort Washington. The Piqua towns mentioned
in some accounts must have been the two Delaware
towns located on the St. Mary&rsquo;s River which was once called
the Pickaway Fork of the Maumee River.</p>
<p>In 1790 there were five hundred acres of cleared land
at and around the junction of the three rivers. Four years
later, on the seventeenth of September, 1794, General
Wayne&rsquo;s army reached the Maumee villages. The next day
that distinguished commander designated the spot on which
to build a fort. On October 22, the work was finished; and
Colonel Hamtramck, after fifteen rounds of cannon were
fired, called it Fort Wayne.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">A SOLDIER&rsquo;S JOURNAL</span></h2>
<p>Colonel Joseph McMaken has obligingly furnished us
for publication the following interesting sketch of General
Harmar&rsquo;s campaign. The writer, Colonel David H. Morris,
Miami County, Ohio, was a sergeant in the expedition and
kept a journal of the most interesting occurrences. Colonel
Morris still has his journal and, at the request of Colonel
McMaken, transcribed this sketch. It may therefore be relied
on as correct; it is, indeed, corroborated by the statements
of the late Chief Richardville and other old residents
of Fort Wayne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fort Washington was the rendezvous. Colonel Hardin,
with a regiment of mounted riflemen, and James Fontaine,
with a troop of cavalrymen from Kentucky and militiamen
from Pennsylvania, joined Harmar here. On September
29, 1790, we began our march and proceeded four miles
toward the Maumee villages near where Fort Wayne now
stands. On the thirtieth of September we moved forward on
the Indian trail leading to the old Chillicothe town on the
Little Miami River. When we arrived there after several
days&rsquo; marching, we fired our guns and reloaded them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the evening we encamped about one mile above
James Galloway&rsquo;s residence. The next day we crossed Mad
River and encamped a little below the site of New Carlisle.
Here we killed twenty cows that had been condemned because
of injuries received from the stronger cattle. The next day
we crossed Indian Creek, which I named in honor of an old
Shawnee chief; the same day we crossed Lost Creek in Miami
County. In the evening we encamped two miles north
of Staunton. On the following day we crossed the Miami
River, just above where Piqua is now located. Indians who
had crossed the river just before us had left their canoe.
They had killed a cub bear, cut the skin into small pieces,
and placed it on stumps. From this circumstance, we were
sure that we had been discovered. That evening we encamped
near Upper Piqua and the next day moved toward the St.
Mary&rsquo;s River. About midday seven Indians were discovered
and pursued by the scouting party. One of them was taken;
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
he proved to be a half-breed about twenty years old, and a
sullen dog he was!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We crossed Loramie Creek next morning, where
Clark or Logan had burned a village some ten years before.
After crossing the divide to the St. Mary&rsquo;s River, we encamped.
A council of war decided that Colonel Hardin with
a detachment from the army should proceed by forced
marches to the Maumee villages, intercept the Indians in
their flight, and, if possible, capture their goods and furs.
In this they were disappointed; all the buildings were on fire
when the detachment arrived. Directly after Colonel Hardin
took possession of the town, two Indians were fired upon as
they rode into the plain west of the St. Joseph River. The
next day their horses were found, and it was supposed from
the quantity of blood discovered that both Indians had been
killed. General Harmar arrived two days after Colonel
Hardin had taken possession of the place. The next day two
Indians were discovered, and one of them was shot down but
not killed. When a young Kentuckian attempted to end the
Indian&rsquo;s misery, his pistol failed to fire; the Indian raised
his rifle and fatally shot the white man through the body.
We remained in this encampment for several days; a great
deal of corn, beans, and other supplies were destroyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the evening of October 16, Captain McClure killed
a Delaware chief called Captain Pauk. On the seventeenth
we remained stationary; this day six brass kettles containing
$32.00 were found buried in the hazel thicket. On the
eighteenth Colonel Hardin was sent up the St. Joseph River
to burn two towns; one was twelve and the other was eighteen
miles from our camp. At the same time General Harmar
marched down the Maumee River to Chillicothe and encamped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Hardin destroyed the Indian towns and on his
return was attacked about ten miles from Fort Wayne, near
the late Captain Hull&rsquo;s farm at Eel River. When the Indians
fired upon them, the Kentucky mounted riflemen wheeled
their horses and made for the camp. The Pennsylvania
militia and the regular soldiers were left a prey to savage
barbarity; one officer and four private soldiers never returned
to the camp. The nineteenth was spent in camp.
Cannon were fired throughout the day in hopes that some of
the men had escaped the massacre and could find the camp
from the sound; none came.</p>

<p class="pcap">TWO INDIANS WERE FIRED UPON</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;On the twentieth we started home and encamped that
night six or seven miles from the Maumee villages. About
midnight David Williams, a spy and our principal guide, who
had been a prisoner among the Indians for many years and
who had been left behind to observe their movements, came
into camp. He reported that about 120 Indians had collected
in the bend opposite the site of Fort Wayne. On hearing this
news, a council resolved to send a detachment back to disperse
them. This force was put under the command of Colonel
Hardin, Major Willis, Captains Ashton and Frothingham
of the regulars, Major Fontaine and Captain Gains of the
Kentucky horse company, and Captains McMullen and Saunders
of the Kentucky mounted riflemen. I have forgotten the
names of the other officers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The troops were put in motion as quickly as possible.
By sunrise they arrived at the ford of the Maumee River.
As soon as our men entered the river, the Indians opened a
brisk fire upon them. Major Fontaine succeeded in gaining
the bank and discovered the main body of Indians concealed
in ambush. He gave orders to halt until the main body of
his men got across the river; at that moment he was shot
dead. By this time the right and left flanks, composed of
Kentucky mounted men, had gained the bank. A small party
of Indians on each wing fled as if defeated, and the horsemen
pursued. As soon as the horsemen were separated
from the footmen, the savages fell upon our people with the
utmost fury. Major Willis was killed charging the enemy.
Captain McMullen discovered the stratagem of the enemy,
wheeled about, approached the back of the Indians, and made
dreadful havoc in their ranks. Captain Ashton was of the
opinion that forty of the enemy fell at the first fire. The
Indians gave way and were driven across the St. Joseph River
with great slaughter. Two soldiers, Captain Ashton says,
signalized themselves on this occasion by using their bayonets
to gig the foe like fish.</p>

<p class="pcap">DAVID WILLIAMS CAME INTO THE CAMP</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;Richardville, a Miami chief now dead, who was in the
engagement, related that the river ran red with blood, and
that he could cross the river on dead bodies. During the
battle an incident occurred that deserves to be noticed. An
old Indian had two boys who rushed into the river by his side.
One son was shot down near him; the old man dropped his
gun and seized his son to save the boy&rsquo;s scalp from his enemies.
The other son was killed also. The father drew them
to shore and sat down between them, where he was killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some blame has been attached to General Harmar
for not returning to aid Colonel Hardin; it is certainly without
foundation. A young Kentuckian, who was wounded through
the wrist while in the river, reported that the enemy was
completely routed and flying. In this sanguinary engagement,
eighty-three regulars were killed; only Captain Ashton
and six privates survived. In both engagements one hundred
militiamen were killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot, in justice to my feelings, close this communication
without saying a word in commendation of General
Harmar. I knew him intimately, for I was favored with
his personal friendship and was in service under his immediate
command for four years, eight months, and twenty-one
days. Throughout the whole of the campaign of which I
have been writing, I was quartered within twenty feet of the
General&rsquo;s marquee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reader will perceive from this fact that I had
the best opportunity of observing everything that happened.
My recollection is greatly assisted by my orderly book, in
which I recorded every order given by the General and every
circumstance I thought worthy of being remembered. But
to conclude, I regard General Harmar as a veteran soldier,
an accomplished gentleman, and especially as a sincere
friend of the poor soldier.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">SPEECH OF JAMES McGREW</span></h2>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
<p>As I stand in your presence, I remember that my father,
John McGrew, was born in York County, Pennsylvania,
in 1766, ten years before the signing of the Declaration of
Independence. I remember that he was married in Westmoreland
County, Pennsylvania, and moved to near Georgetown,
Kentucky, in 1788. He was one of those men who
commenced the settlement of the Ohio Valley, the centennial
of which is being so generally celebrated this year. I remember
that in 1788 my father&rsquo;s brother, sick on a flatboat
that was decoyed to the shore just above the mouth of the
Licking River opposite where Cincinnati now stands, was
thought to have been tomahawked, for he was never heard
from afterward. It was the custom of the Indians to tomahawk
all sick persons who could not be carried into captivity.
I also remember that my father was in the bloody and disastrous
Indian fight just across your own Maumee River in
1790.</p>
<p>I say I remember these facts. Yes, as they with a
multitude of other events come rushing upon my memory, I
feel as though I belonged in the dim distance of the past age.
Yet, I am glad to be among you today to assist in calling up
these recollections and in doing honor to the brave and heroic
men&mdash;and women, too, God bless them&mdash;who blazed
their way through the dense forests of this northwestern region
ninety to one hundred years ago.</p>
<p>I do not know that I can do better than to recite much
of what I wrote to Allan H. Dougall. My letter to him was
written last December at the suggestion of the Honorable
Charles F. Muhler, mayor of your city. It came about in
this way. I saw in the CHICAGO DAILY NEWS of October
23, 1887, that Henry M. Williams of your city had erected
a handsome iron fence around the ground formerly occupied
by the old fort. He had also erected a flagpole, from the
top of which floated a beautiful American flag. And he had
formally presented the whole to your city on October 22,
1887, the ninety-third anniversary of the dedication of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
old fort. It was stated that this was also the ninety-seventh
anniversary of General Harmar&rsquo;s battle with the Indians at
the ford of the Maumee River.</p>
<p>This statement called to my mind the fact that my father
was in that engagement with the Indians, and I stated
this in a letter to Mayor Muhler. In reply, he wrote me
that Colonel Dougall was greatly interested in the early history
of Fort Wayne and the Maumee Valley, and that the
Colonel would be glad to learn any facts from me relating
to the early history of this area. This caused me to write
the letter I will now read. Some of you may have read it
last winter when it was published in one of your city papers.
But as there are doubtless many persons here who have not
seen or heard it, you will excuse my reading it before your
society.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lr">Kankakee, Illinois</p>
<p class="lr">December 11, 1887</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Allan H. Dougall, Esq.</p>
<p class="t0">Fort Wayne, Indiana</p>
<p class="t0">Dear Sir:</p>
</div>
<p>Mayor C. F. Muhler states in his letter, dated November
22, that you are the local secretary of the Maumee
Valley Monumental and Historical Association, and that you
are greatly interested in the early history of Fort Wayne
and the Maumee Valley. As my father was with General
Harmar in his 1790 campaign against the Indians of the Old
Northwest, Mayor Muhler wrote that you thought I must
have gained a good deal of traditional information about the
Indian campaigns between 1790 and 1794 and about the early
history of Fort Wayne.</p>
<p>Well, such is the case, especially in reference to
General Harmar&rsquo;s defeat on the twenty-second of October,
1790. In order to come to a better understanding of what
gave rise to General Harmar&rsquo;s campaign and other expeditions
against the Indians of the Northwest, it is necessary
for us to recall the treaty made at Fort Harmar on January
9, 1789, by Governor St. Clair with the chiefs and warriors
of the Wyandot, Chippewa, Potawatomi, and Sauk nations.
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
This treaty was a renewal and confirmation of the agreement
previously made at Fort McIntosh, and it was hoped
that the early settlers would be secure in a large degree
from molestation by these and the other Indian tribes in the
Ohio Valley and the Miami of the Lakes. Undoubtedly this
treaty, which gave the general impression that immigrants
to the Ohio Valley would be secure against serious molestation,
induced the tide of immigration in this direction immediately
thereafter.</p>
<p>But it was soon found that notwithstanding this treaty,
roving bands of Indians were continuing to commit depredations
upon all the new settlements. Horses, cattle, and
other forms of property were stolen; settlers were captured
and carried off as prisoners; and quite a number of white
men were killed near the Miami River. The feeling of alarm
and insecurity became very general, and blockhouses were
erected in nearly all the new settlements.</p>
<p>In June, 1789, Major Doughty with about 140 men
commenced building Fort Washington where Cincinnati now
stands. In the fall of that year, General Harmar with three
hundred men arrived and took possession of the fort. After
all negotiations with the Indians had failed, General Harmar
was ordered to attack their towns. In compliance with this
order, in the summer and fall of 1790 he gathered a force
of thirteen hundred men at Fort Washington. Less than one
fourth of the men were regular soldiers; the others were
volunteer militiamen. In September he commenced his
march against the Indians of the Maumee country, known in
early times as the Miami of the Lakes. The Indians were
constantly committing depredations upon the white settlers
in southern Ohio, northern Kentucky, and, indeed, throughout
the entire Ohio Valley.</p>
<p>My father, who had moved from Pennsylvania to Kentucky
in 1788, was one of the mounted volunteers who accompanied
General Harmar. They marched, as I now recollect,
via Greenville, Ohio, to the Maumee country, where
they destroyed a few patches of corn and an Indian village
near the site of Fort Wayne. Having accomplished this,
General Harmar proposed to march back to Fort Washington.
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
This caused great dissatisfaction among the volunteer forces;
and a proposition was made to recruit volunteers to attack
the Indians, who were known to be not far beyond the north
side of the Maumee River.</p>
<p>The volunteer force was organized under Colonel Hardin
and other brave officers. On the morning of October 22,
1790, they forded the Maumee River and pushed north to a
small prairie, with a boggy strip in the middle which was
troublesome to cross on horseback. The Indians lay concealed
in the timber on the opposite side. The two rangers
and the greater part of the command had crossed the bog
and were approaching the timber, wholly unconscious of impending
danger, when suddenly the rangers were shot down.
My father said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was an awful pause; then all at once the whole
forest seemed on fire (this was the result of flintlocks), accompanied
by the reports of hundreds of rifles, which sent
a shower of bullets into our ranks and resulted in fearful
loss of life. My comrades fell on all sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the hasty retreat that followed, the horses made a
rapid approach to the bog and naturally sank into it. While
they were struggling through the quagmire, the Indians had
a decided advantage. The greatest loss of life occurred here
and at the attempted refording of the river. The survivors
were scattered in every direction.</p>
<p>My father was one of the five who, under the leadership
of &ldquo;Indian Davie&rdquo; (who at one time had been an Indian
prisoner), pushed northward through a terrible tangle of
grapevines, greenbriers, and hazel brush which grew along
the St. Joseph River. They succeeded in crossing the river
quite a distance above its junction with the St. Mary&rsquo;s. Then
they made their way back on the west side of the river to a
point nearly opposite Harmar&rsquo;s headquarters. Here they
crossed the St. Mary&rsquo;s River and came into camp with their
clothes almost torn off them and their flesh fearfully lacerated
by thorns and greenbriers.</p>
<p>My father was very severe in his denunciation of General
Harmar. He said that Harmar neither sent help to
cover the retreating forces nor provided help which the
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
wounded men needed to get back to camp. All Harmar did
was to keep a cannon booming so that the stragglers might
know where the camp was. Once, after having heard what
someone had written in palliation of Harmar&rsquo;s conduct on
that occasion, my father replied: &ldquo;There is not a word of
truth in what he says; Harmar was a distressed old coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To give you some idea of my father&rsquo;s courage and daring,
I will mention one instance. He moved from Kentucky
in 1796 and located five miles south of Dayton, Ohio. Soon
after he settled there, the Indians stole a mare and two colts
from him. Later he found two of the horses at an Indian
camp just across the Miami River from Dayton. He tried
to get someone in Dayton to go with him to get the mare and
colt, but no one dared go. He went to the camp about sundown.
As there were only two or three squaws in camp, he
took his mare and colt and made all possible speed toward
home, which he reached in safety and where he stood sentinel
all night.</p>
<p>Mrs. Shroyer saw him pass two miles south of Dayton.
A short time later she was shocked and trembled with
fear as she saw three Indians in hot pursuit with rifles and
tomahawks. Fortunately, night came on, and they lost his
trail. The next day my father took his rifle and went alone
to the camp. By signs he made them understand that he had
retrieved the mare and colt that they had stolen from him.
He demanded the other two-year-old colt. By signs, they
indicated that it was dead. The Indians never disturbed him
again.</p>
<p>My father was engaged in forwarding supplies for General
William Henry Harrison&rsquo;s forces at the time of the
fight with the Indians at the Battle of Tippecanoe. I was with
my father at Germantown, Montgomery County, Ohio, in the
summer of 1840, when he met General Harrison (afterward
President Harrison) for the first time after the Tippecanoe
campaign. Had I time, I could tell you other exploits of my
father with the Indians, but I forbear wearing out your patience.
I doubt if there is another man living whose father
was in that fight with the Indians on October 22 at the ford
of the Maumee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Most of this information is traditional, handed down
from father to son. I have been greatly helped in calling
to mind many of these incidents and occurrences by my
brother-in-law, Dr. Samuel H. Binkley, of Alexanderville,
Montgomery County, Ohio. He is a geologist of high standing
and is one of the noted archaeologists in the country.
Dr. Binkley has one of the finest geological and archaeological
cabinets to be seen in the West. This collection is
closely related to historical and monumental matters.</p>
<p>I will mention that I, too, have some early recollections
of Fort Wayne. In the fall of 1838 I passed through
here, driving a three-horse team moving a relative to Whitley
County, Indiana, near where Columbia City now stands.
As I now recollect, Fort Wayne was then a town of log
houses, principally. I think the courthouse was a square
building with a roof run up to a point from all four sides.
If I am not right in this, some of you old settlers can correct
me. I passed through this city in 1846 or 1847 on a
canalboat with Mr. Tabour, an early settler at Logansport.
About the same time, I passed through with Mr. Elsworth,
of Lafayette, who was at that time commissioner of patents
at Washington. In 1856 Olif Johnson and Colonel Sweet of
Galva, Illinois, General Thomas Henderson, now in Congress
from the seventh Illinois district, and I went bathing
(we called it swimming) in the Maumee River a short distance
below your then small city.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="lr">Sincerely yours,</p>
<p class="lr">JAMES McGREW</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>You will agree that I have some personal recollections
of your city and the Maumee country. I think of Fort Wayne
and the Maumee country as historic ground, baptised with
the blood of brave and patriotic men. These men were as
heroic as any who have lived in this country; and their toils,
hardships, daring, and courage, as well as their patriotism,
deserve to be kept green in our memories.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
